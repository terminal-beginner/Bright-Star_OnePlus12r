## Your warranty is no longer valid!

I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or the current economic crisis. Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this kernel before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point your finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.

## Other Links: [Kernel Flasher - fatalcoder524 fork](https://github.com/fatalcoder524/KernelFlasher)

## Installation instructions: 

- Flash AK3 zip in kernel flasher
- Flash Wireless Firmware for Nethunter provided in the releases 
- Download and Unzip kernel modules in internal storage and load them using `insmod module_name.ko`

----

## Loading rtw88 drivers

If you have unzipped all the drivers in internal storage and want to load drivers for let's say rtl8821au chipset,

- Step 0: cd into the directory where all kernel modules are unzipped 
- Step 1: `rmmod mac80211`
- Step 2: `insmod mac80211.ko`

> [!WARNING] 
> The first two steps are necessary otherwise you'll get unknown symbol error (__ieee80211_create_tpt_led_trigger) 

- Step 2: `insmod rtw_core.ko`
- Step 3: `insmod rtw_usb.ko`
- Step 4: `insmod rtw_88xxa.ko`
- Step 5: `insmod rtw_8821a.ko`
- Step 6: `insmod rtw_8821au.ko`
